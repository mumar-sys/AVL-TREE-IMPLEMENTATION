# AVL-TREE-IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation of AVL Tree Data Structure
                                   ***Following code is written to implement the behaviour of AVL Tree***
                                                         **Code File includes**

***Following code includes two classes 
***Following code includes three main functions which includes Insert, Delete and Search.
***Following code includes Four supporting functions which includes rotations, height and balance calulator.
***Following Code includes Four complemetary functions which includes minmum,maximum, successor and predecessor.
***Following Code includes One implemtation of AVL Tree.
                                                         **How to Use**

***You can insert your values in the tree by calling the AVL_INSERT function in the code by giving it the key.
***You can check your values in the tree by calling AVL_SEARCH function in the code by providing the key.
***YOu can delete your values in the tree by calling AVL_DELETE function in the code.
***The Delete code has all the three cases implemented in it.
***You can find minimum, maxmimum by calling their respective function.
***You can find sucessor, predeccsor by calling theri respective function.
***You can use AVL_Implementation function to check on of the implementation of avl tree.
***Implementation basically sorts the data in effeicent way.
                                                          **Remainder**

***ALways Use the object named tree with the function you want to use.
                                                          **Precautions**

***Donot try to make changes in the code.
***Some values are there in the driver code to show the behaviour.
                                                         **Overall Complexity**

***The overall code is implemented in O(lg*n).
                                                         **Visulaization**

*** You can visualize your tree by using th
